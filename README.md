## Examples for accessible resources
This repository provides examples for those interested in creating accessible resources for presentation and publication. It is intended more as a jumping-off point for people to start exploring how to make and use accessible resources, not as an exhaustive list of methods/examples.

Additions to this repository are welcome! Feel free to PR and add/edit or add Issues/Features requests here on GitHub.

### Files here:
* `accessible_plots.ipynb`: notebook covering some methods for making plots more accessible, including linestyles and colormaps
* `main.tex`, `ex_map.png`, and `Accessible_example.pdf`: TeX code and output using the "accessibility" and "axessibility" packages with a sample figure, created using the above notebook

## Some great resources
* The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has a [great resource for colorblindness](https://www.cta-observatory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CTA_ColourBlindnessBestPractices.pdf)
* List of colormaps and types from [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html)
